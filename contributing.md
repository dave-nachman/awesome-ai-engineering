# Contribution Guidelines

This awesome list is quite new. To help ensure that it doesn't bloat over time and become less and less curated, please be aware that while contributions are encouraged at the end of the day this repo is largely my own personal, biased thoughts, at least until a more mature set of contribution guidelines is created.

You are more than welcome to fork this and create/maintain your own list of awesome resources if you disagree with choices I've made.

That said, I'm happy to review any and all contributions. Here's the process:
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion and include a reason why it is awesome.
- Order within a section is alphabetical
- If you think something belongs in a different category or think there needs to be a new category, feel free to suggest edits as well

For tools, please only submit items that you know to be of high quality and are not brand new.
